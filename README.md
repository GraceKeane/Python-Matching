# Python-Matching
Graph Theory matching algorithm. This program is a continuation from my automaton fragments code. It parses the regular expression from infix to postfic notation and then builds a series of small NFA's for parts of the regular expression. This program then creates a matching algorithm that takes a regular expression and a string and determines do they match by simply outputing "True" or "False".
